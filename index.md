- Markdown does have collapsable sections, even nested, and uses tag syntax needing ends which breaks easy additions.
  - Two spaces does indent in Markdown, so must need to render collapsing/folding with: 
      - html? 
       - in jekyll?
       - 
<details><summary>Hello</summary><blockquote>text1
  text2
<details>text4<summary>World</summary><blockquote>
:smile: text3
</blockquote></details>
</blockquote></details>
